## Overview
The input–process–output (IPO) model is a widely used approach in systems analysis and software engineering for describing the structure of an information processing program or another process. Many introductory programming and systems analysis texts introduce this as the most basic structure for describing a process.

## Discussion
A computer program or any other sort of process using the input-process-output model receives inputs from a user or other source, does some computations on the inputs, and returns the results of the computations. The system divides the work into three categories:

- A requirement from the environment (input)
- A computation based on the requirement (process)
- A provision for the environment (output)

### Example: [Your Program Title]
[Describe what your program does here]

Following the IPO model, the program must:
1. [Describe the input step]
2. [Describe the process/calculation step]
3. [Describe the output step]

## Pseudocode
```
Function Main
    ... [Description of what this program does]
    Declare [DataType] [variableName]
    Declare [DataType] [variableName]
    
    Output "[Your prompt message]"
    Input [variableName]
    Assign [resultVariable] = [your calculation/process]
    Output [your output string with variables]
End
```

## Output
```
[Paste your program output here]
```
