## Overview

The input–process–output (IPO) model is a widely used approach in systems analysis and software engineering for describing the structure of an information processing program or another process. Many introductory programming and systems analysis texts introduce this as the most basic structure for describing a process.

## Discussion

A computer program or any other sort of process using the input-process-output model receives inputs from a user or other source, does some computations on the inputs, and returns the results of the computations. The system divides the work into three categories:

- A requirement from the environment (input)
- A computation based on the requirement (process)
- A provision for the environment (output)

### Example: Cities with Countries and Currency App

This React Native mobile application extends the Cities App by adding two new screens — **AddCountry** and **Countries** — integrated into a Bottom Tab Navigator alongside the existing Cities and AddCity screens.

Following the IPO model, the program must:

1. **Input:** The user navigates to the AddCountry tab and enters a country name and its corresponding currency into two text input fields. The form validates that both fields are non-empty before submission.
2. **Process:** On submission, the app constructs a new country object containing the entered name, currency, and a unique UUID generated by `react-native-uuid`. This object is passed via a lifted-state callback (`addCountry`) up to the root `App` component, which appends it to the `countries` array held in component state.
3. **Output:** The Countries tab renders the updated `countries` array as a scrollable list, displaying each country's name and currency. If no countries have been added yet, a centered "No saved countries!" message is shown instead.

## Pseudocode

```
Function Main
    Declare Array countries = []

    // AddCountry Screen
    Output "Prompt user for Country Name and Currency"
    Input countryName, currency
    Validate countryName != "" AND currency != ""
    Assign newCountry = { country: countryName, currency: currency, id: uuid() }
    Assign countries = [...countries, newCountry]
    Navigate to Countries screen

    // Countries Screen
    If countries.length == 0
        Output "No saved countries!"
    Else
        For each country in countries
            Output country.name
            Output country.currency
        End For
    End If
End
```

## Output

```
// Empty state
Countries screen: "No saved countries!"

// After adding USA / Dollar
Countries screen:
  USA
  Dollar

// After adding Korea / Won
Countries screen:
  USA
  Dollar
  -----
  Korea
  Won
```

## Flowchart

```
[User opens AddCountry tab]
        |
        v
[Enter Country Name + Currency]
        |
        v
[Both fields filled?] --No--> [Alert: "please complete form"]
        |
       Yes
        v
[Create country object with UUID]
        |
        v
[addCountry() updates App state]
        |
        v
[Navigate to Countries tab]
        |
        v
[Countries list renders updated data]
```
